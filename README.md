## What’s Cookin’

From the main page user scroll through a list of all of the recipes and save the ones that they like, which will then appear in their favorites tab. Users can also see the details of the recipes by clicking the “Click to see more button”. Inside of the pop-up you will find the instructions for the recipe, the ingredients, and the estimated cost in cents.  When a user clicks the “like” button the recipe will be saved to their favorite recipes tab. From the favorite recipes tab users have the option to remove recipes from their favorites or click the “Add to recipes to cook” button than that recipe will appear in the recipes to cook tab.
